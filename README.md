Objective: Predict the median house price in California using available housing features.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Introduction
Welcome to the "California Housing Price Prediction" project. This initiative uses advanced machine learning techniques to predict housing prices in California based on specific features like median income and average number of rooms, leveraging the California Housing Dataset. This project applies Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on two key features from the California Housing Dataset (provided by Scikit-learn).The dataset contains various housing-related attributes, including income levels and the number of rooms per household.

## ðŸ“ˆ Project Details

### Objective
**Goal**: Predict house prices using the median income (MedInc) and average number of rooms (AveRooms) through linear regression analysis.

### Dataset
We utilize the California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn, focusing on:
- **MedInc**: Median income within a block.
- **AveRooms**: Average number of rooms per household.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation**: Load and explore the dataset to understand the underlying patterns.
2. **Visual Analysis**: Generate visual plots such as histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to detect trends and outliers.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and select features that are predictive of housing prices.
4. **Modeling**: Construct and train a linear regression model on the training data.
5. **Evaluation**: Apply RÂ², MAE, and RMSE metrics to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance.
6. **Preservation**: Save the trained model for future analysis or deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Results & Metrics
Performance metrics for the model include:
- **RÂ² Score**: 0.46 â€“ explaining 46% of the variance in housing prices.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 0.6247 â€“ indicating the average error in predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 0.8379 â€“ showing the standard deviation of prediction errors.
